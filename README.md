# ðŸ“š Simple Library System (Java)

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This is a simple Java-based console application for managing a basic library system.  
The system allows users to:
- Add books to the library
- Search for books by title or author
- Display the list of all books
- Track the availability status of books

The project applies basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, encapsulation, and arrays.

- **LibrarySystemm.java**: Contains the `main()` method to demonstrate the system via user input and randomly generated book data.
